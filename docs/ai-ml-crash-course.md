## Core AI/ML Concepts

### What is Machine Learning?

Imagine teaching a computer to recognize cats in photos without explicitly telling it what a cat looks like. That's the essence of machine learning! Instead of writing thousands of if-then rules, we show the computer thousands of examples and let it figure out the patterns itself. Machine Learning is like giving a computer the ability to learn from experience, just like humans do, but at a much faster pace and with the ability to process vast amounts of data that would overwhelm any human.

The beauty of ML lies in its versatility - it can help doctors diagnose diseases by learning from medical images, enable self-driving cars to navigate by understanding road conditions, or help Netflix recommend your next favorite show by learning your viewing patterns. At its core, ML is about finding the hidden relationships in data and using those relationships to make intelligent predictions about the future.

### What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task. The core idea is to build mathematical models that can identify patterns in data and use these patterns to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.

**Key Types:**

#### Supervised Learning
- **Definition**: Learning with labeled examples (input-output pairs)
- **Goal**: Learn a mapping function from inputs to outputs
- **Examples**: Email spam detection, house price prediction, image classification
- **Process**: Train on labeled data → Learn patterns → Predict on new data
- **Key Challenge**: Requires high-quality labeled data

#### Unsupervised Learning
- **Definition**: Finding patterns in data without labels
- **Goal**: Discover hidden structure in data
- **Examples**: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction
- **Process**: Analyze data patterns → Group similar items → Extract insights
- **Key Challenge**: No ground truth to validate results

#### Reinforcement Learning
- **Definition**: Learning through interaction with environment and feedback
- **Goal**: Learn optimal actions to maximize cumulative reward
- **Examples**: Game playing (AlphaGo), autonomous driving, trading algorithms
- **Process**: Take action → Receive reward/penalty → Update strategy
- **Key Challenge**: Exploration vs exploitation trade-off

### Essential Terminology

#### Data-Related Terms
- **Features (X)**: Input variables used to make predictions (also called attributes, predictors, independent variables)
- **Labels/Targets (y)**: Output variables we want to predict (also called dependent variables, outcomes)

## Machine Learning Algorithms

Think of machine learning algorithms as different tools in a craftsman's workshop - each one is designed for a specific type of job, and choosing the right tool makes all the difference between success and frustration. Just as you wouldn't use a hammer to cut wood, you wouldn't use a decision tree for image recognition or a neural network for simple linear relationships.

The art of machine learning lies not just in understanding how each algorithm works, but in knowing when to use which one. It's like being a chef who knows exactly which spice will bring out the best flavor in each dish. Some algorithms are like precision instruments - they work beautifully when conditions are just right, while others are like Swiss Army knives - versatile and reliable in many situations.

The journey through these algorithms is fascinating because each one represents a different philosophical approach to learning from data. Linear regression believes in simplicity and interpretability, while neural networks embrace complexity in pursuit of accuracy. Random forests democratize decision-making by letting many voices vote, while SVMs focus on finding the perfect boundary between different classes.

### Understanding Algorithm Selection
Choosing the right algorithm depends on several factors:
- **Problem Type**: Classification vs Regression vs Clustering
- **Data Size**: Small datasets favor simpler models, large datasets can handle complex models
- **Data Quality**: Noisy data benefits from robust algorithms
- **Interpretability**: Some applications require explainable models
- **Training Time**: Real-time applications need fast training
- **Prediction Time**: Some applications require fast inference

### Supervised Learning Algorithms

#### 1. Linear Regression

Linear regression is like the foundation of machine learning - it's the first algorithm most people learn, and for good reason! Imagine you're trying to predict house prices. You notice that bigger houses tend to cost more, and houses in better neighborhoods also cost more. Linear regression takes this intuitive idea and makes it mathematical, finding the best straight line through your data points.

What makes linear regression so powerful is its simplicity and interpretability. When you see a coefficient of 0.5 for house size, you immediately know that for every additional square foot, the price increases by $500 (if your data is in thousands). It's like having a crystal ball that shows you exactly how each factor influences your outcome.

But here's the beautiful thing about linear regression - despite its simplicity, it often performs surprisingly well. Many real-world relationships are approximately linear, and even when they're not, linear regression can serve as an excellent baseline. It's the algorithm that taught us that sometimes the simplest explanation is the best one.

**Purpose**: Predict continuous values (regression problems)
**Mathematical Foundation**: 
- Assumes linear relationship: y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε
- Minimizes sum of squared residuals: RSS = Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²
- Uses Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) to find optimal coefficients

**How it works**: 
- Finds the best line (or hyperplane) through data points
- Minimizes the distance between predicted and actual values
- Assumes linear relationship between features and target

**Key Assumptions**:
- Linear relationship between features and target
- Independence of observations
- Homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors)
- Normal distribution of errors
- No multicollinearity (features not highly correlated)

**Advantages**:
- Simple and interpretable
- Fast training and prediction
- No hyperparameters to tune
- Works well with small datasets
- Provides confidence intervals

**Disadvantages**:
- Assumes linear relationships
- Sensitive to outliers
- Can't handle non-linear patterns
- Requires feature scaling for meaningful coefficients

**When to use**:
- Linear relationship exists
- Need interpretable results
- Small to medium datasets
- Baseline model for comparison

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
import numpy as np

# Basic usage
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate performance
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"MSE: {mse:.2f}, R²: {r2:.2f}")

# Access coefficients
print(f"Intercept: {model.intercept_:.2f}")
print(f"Coefficients: {model.coef_}")

# Feature importance (absolute coefficient values)
feature_importance = np.abs(model.coef_)
feature_names = X.columns
importance_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature': feature_names,
    'importance': feature_importance
}).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)
```

#### 2. Logistic Regression

If linear regression is the foundation, then logistic regression is the elegant evolution that handles one of the most common problems in machine learning: classification. Picture this - you're building a spam filter. Linear regression might predict values like 0.3 or 1.7, but what does 1.7 mean for "spam" or "not spam"? Logistic regression solves this beautifully by squashing any input into a probability between 0 and 1.

The magic of logistic regression lies in the sigmoid function - that beautiful S-shaped curve that transforms any number into a probability. It's like having a translator that converts the language of continuous numbers into the language of probabilities. When the sigmoid outputs 0.8, you know there's an 80% chance this email is spam.

What I love about logistic regression is how it bridges the gap between simplicity and sophistication. It's still linear in its core (the relationship between features and log-odds is linear), but it handles the non-linear nature of probabilities with elegance. It's the algorithm that taught us that you don't always need complex models to solve complex-looking problems.

**Purpose**: Binary and multiclass classification (yes/no, spam/not spam, image categories)
**Mathematical Foundation**:
- Uses logistic function (sigmoid) to map linear combinations to probabilities
- Formula: P(y=1|x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z)) where z = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ
- Decision boundary: Linear in feature space
- Loss function: Cross-entropy (log-likelihood)

**How it works**:
1. **Linear Combination**: Calculate z = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ
2. **Sigmoid Transformation**: Apply σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z)) to get probabilities
3. **Decision Making**: Classify as positive if P(y=1|x) > 0.5 (or custom threshold)
4. **Optimization**: Use maximum likelihood estimation or gradient descent

**Key Concepts**:
- **Odds Ratio**: e^(βᵢ) represents how odds change with one unit increase in xᵢ
- **Log-Odds**: ln(P/(1-P)) = β₀ + β₁x₁ + ... + βₙxₙ (linear relationship)
- **Decision Boundary**: Linear hyperplane in feature space
- **Multiclass**: Uses One-vs-Rest or Multinomial approaches

**Advantages**:
- Probabilistic output (confidence scores)
- Interpretable coefficients
- No assumptions about feature distributions
- Works well with small datasets
- Handles both linear and non-linear relationships (with feature engineering)

**Disadvantages**:
- Assumes linear relationship between features and log-odds
- Sensitive to outliers
- Requires feature scaling for meaningful coefficients
- Can struggle with non-linear decision boundaries

**When to use**:
- Binary or multiclass classification
- Need probabilistic predictions
- Want interpretable model
- Linear decision boundary is reasonable
- Small to medium datasets

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, roc_auc_score
import numpy as np

# Basic logistic regression
model = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions and probabilities
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
probabilities = model.predict_proba(X_test)

# Evaluate performance
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions))
print(f"AUC Score: {roc_auc_score(y_test, probabilities[:, 1]):.3f}")

# Access coefficients and interpretability
print(f"Intercept: {model.intercept_[0]:.3f}")
print("Coefficients:")
for feature, coef in zip(X.columns, model.coef_[0]):
    print(f"  {feature}: {coef:.3f}")

# Calculate odds ratios
odds_ratios = np.exp(model.coef_[0])
print("Odds Ratios:")
for feature, odds in zip(X.columns, odds_ratios):
    print(f"  {feature}: {odds:.3f}")

# Feature importance (absolute coefficient values)
feature_importance = np.abs(model.coef_[0])
importance_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature': X.columns,
    'coefficient': model.coef_[0],
    'odds_ratio': odds_ratios,
    'importance': feature_importance
}).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

# Multiclass logistic regression
multiclass_model = LogisticRegression(multi_class='multinomial', solver='lbfgs')
multiclass_model.fit(X_train, y_train_multiclass)

# Custom threshold for binary classification
threshold = 0.3  # Lower threshold for more sensitive classification
custom_predictions = (probabilities[:, 1] > threshold).astype(int)
```

#### 3. Decision Trees

Decision trees are like the Sherlock Holmes of machine learning algorithms - they ask a series of intelligent questions to solve mysteries hidden in your data. Imagine you're trying to predict whether someone will buy a product. A decision tree might start by asking "Is their income above $50,000?" If yes, it asks "Are they under 35?" If no, it asks "Do they have children?" Each question narrows down the possibilities until it reaches a confident prediction.

What makes decision trees so appealing is their human-like reasoning process. You can literally read the tree like a flowchart and understand exactly how it makes decisions. It's like having a conversation with your model: "Well, if the customer is young and has a high income, and they've bought similar products before, then there's an 85% chance they'll buy this one too."

The beauty of decision trees lies in their ability to capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features without any mathematical complexity. They automatically discover the most important features and create intuitive rules. However, like a detective who asks too many questions, they can become overly specific and lose their ability to generalize to new cases - a phenomenon we call overfitting.

**Purpose**: Classification and regression with interpretable rules and non-linear decision boundaries
**Mathematical Foundation**:
- **Tree Structure**: Hierarchical set of if-then-else rules
- **Splitting Criteria**: 
  - Classification: Gini Impurity, Entropy, Information Gain
  - Regression: Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error
- **Leaf Nodes**: Final predictions (class probabilities or continuous values)
- **Decision Path**: Sequence of conditions from root to leaf

**How it works**:
1. **Root Node**: Start with entire dataset
2. **Feature Selection**: Choose best feature to split on
3. **Split Creation**: Create branches based on feature values
4. **Recursive Splitting**: Repeat for each child node
5. **Stopping Criteria**: Stop when pure nodes, max depth, or min samples reached
6. **Prediction**: Follow path to leaf node for final prediction

**Key Concepts**:

##### Splitting Criteria for Classification
**Gini Impurity**: G = 1 - Σ(pᵢ)²
- Measures probability of misclassifying a randomly chosen element
- Range: 0 (pure) to 0.5 (maximum impurity for binary classification)
- Lower values indicate better splits

**Entropy**: H = -Σ(pᵢ × log₂(pᵢ))
- Measures disorder/uncertainty in the data
- Range: 0 (pure) to log₂(k) for k classes
- Information Gain = Entropy(parent) - Weighted Average Entropy(children)

**Information Gain**: IG = H(parent) - Σ(nᵢ/n × H(childᵢ))
- Measures reduction in entropy after split
- Higher values indicate better splits

##### Splitting Criteria for Regression
**Mean Squared Error**: MSE = Σ(yᵢ - ŷ)² / n
- Minimizes variance within each split
- Most commonly used for regression trees

**Mean Absolute Error**: MAE = Σ|yᵢ - ŷ| / n
- Less sensitive to outliers than MSE

**Advantages**:
- **Interpretable**: Easy to understand and explain
- **No Preprocessing**: Handles mixed data types, missing values
- **Non-linear**: Can capture complex interactions
- **Feature Selection**: Automatically selects important features
- **Robust**: Less sensitive to outliers and scaling
- **Fast**: Quick training and prediction

**Disadvantages**:
- **Overfitting**: Prone to memorizing training data
- **Instability**: Small data changes can create very different trees
- **Bias**: Favors features with many possible splits
- **Poor Generalization**: Often performs worse than ensemble methods

**When to use**:
- Need interpretable model
- Mixed data types (categorical + numerical)
- Want to understand feature interactions
- Small to medium datasets
- As base learner for ensemble methods

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, DecisionTreeRegressor, export_text, plot_tree
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, mean_squared_error
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

importance_df = pd.DataFrame({

}).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

print("Feature Importance:")
print(importance_df)

    tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42, ccp_alpha=alpha)
    tree.fit(X_train, y_train)
    train_scores.append(tree.score(X_train, y_train))
    val_scores.append(tree.score(X_val, y_val))

plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

#### 4. Random Forest

If decision trees are like individual detectives, then Random Forest is like assembling a whole detective agency where each detective specializes in different aspects of the case. Instead of relying on one tree's opinion, Random Forest asks hundreds of trees to vote on the final decision. It's democracy in action - even if some trees make mistakes, the majority usually gets it right.

The genius of Random Forest lies in its two clever tricks: first, it trains each tree on a different random sample of the data (like giving each detective different evidence), and second, it only lets each tree consider a random subset of features at each decision point (like having each detective focus on different clues). This prevents all the trees from thinking alike and makes the ensemble much more robust.

What I find fascinating about Random Forest is how it transforms the weaknesses of individual decision trees into strengths. Single trees are prone to overfitting and can be unstable, but when you combine many slightly different trees, their individual errors cancel out, and you get a model that's both accurate and reliable. It's like the wisdom of crowds applied to machine learning - the collective intelligence of many simple models often outperforms a single complex one.

**Purpose**: Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting and improve generalization
**Mathematical Foundation**:
- **Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging)**: Train multiple models on different bootstrap samples
- **Random Feature Selection**: At each split, consider only random subset of features
- **Voting/Averaging**: Combine predictions from all trees
- **Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error**: Estimate generalization error without separate validation set

**How it works**:
1. **Bootstrap Sampling**: Create multiple datasets by sampling with replacement
2. **Random Feature Selection**: For each tree, randomly select subset of features at each split
3. **Tree Training**: Train each tree on its bootstrap sample
4. **Prediction Aggregation**: 
   - Classification: Majority voting or probability averaging
   - Regression: Average of all tree predictions
5. **OOB Evaluation**: Use out-of-bag samples for unbiased error estimation

**Key Concepts**:

##### Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging)
- **Bootstrap Sample**: Random sample with replacement (same size as original)
- **Reduces Variance**: Multiple models average out individual errors
- **Parallelizable**: Trees can be trained independently
- **Stability**: Less sensitive to data variations

##### Random Feature Selection
- **Feature Subset**: Randomly select √p features (where p = total features)
- **Reduces Correlation**: Prevents trees from being too similar
- **Improves Diversity**: Each tree focuses on different feature combinations
- **Handles High Dimensions**: Works well with many features

##### Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error
- **OOB Sample**: Data points not included in bootstrap sample
- **Unbiased Estimate**: OOB error approximates test error
- **No Validation Split**: Don't need separate validation set
- **Feature Importance**: Can calculate using OOB samples

**Advantages**:
- **Reduces Overfitting**: Multiple trees average out individual errors
- **Handles Missing Data**: Can impute missing values during training
- **Feature Importance**: Provides ranking of feature importance
- **Robust**: Less sensitive to outliers and noise
- **Parallelizable**: Fast training on multiple cores
- **No Scaling Required**: Works with original feature scales
- **Handles Mixed Data**: Categorical and numerical features

**Disadvantages**:
- **Less Interpretable**: Harder to understand than single tree
- **Memory Intensive**: Stores multiple trees
- **Can Overfit**: With too many trees or insufficient regularization
- **Biased with Categorical Variables**: Favors high-cardinality categorical features

**When to use**:
- Need robust, generalizable model
- High-dimensional data
- Mixed data types
- Want feature importance
- Baseline for comparison
- When interpretability is less important than performance

#### 5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support Vector Machines are like the Zen masters of machine learning - they focus on finding the perfect balance, the optimal boundary that separates different classes with maximum margin. Imagine you're drawing a line to separate red and blue dots on a piece of paper. Most algorithms would draw any line that works, but SVM asks: "What's the widest possible street I can draw between these two groups?"

The philosophy behind SVM is elegant: instead of trying to classify every point correctly, it focuses on the points that matter most - the support vectors. These are the data points closest to the decision boundary, the ones that would be most affected if the boundary moved even slightly. It's like identifying the key witnesses in a court case - you don't need to interview everyone, just the people whose testimony could change the outcome.

What makes SVM particularly fascinating is the "kernel trick" - a mathematical sleight of hand that allows it to find non-linear boundaries without actually transforming the data into higher dimensions. It's like being able to see patterns in 3D space while only working in 2D. This makes SVM incredibly powerful for complex classification problems while maintaining strong theoretical guarantees about its performance.

**Purpose**: Classification and regression with strong theoretical foundation
**Mathematical Foundation**:
- **Margin**: Distance between decision boundary and nearest data points
- **Support Vectors**: Data points closest to decision boundary
- **Optimization**: Maximize margin while minimizing classification errors
- **Kernel Trick**: Map data to higher-dimensional space for non-linear separation

**How it works**:
1. **Margin Maximization**: Find hyperplane with maximum margin between classes
2. **Support Vector Identification**: Identify data points that define the margin
3. **Constraint Optimization**: Minimize ||w||² subject to yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b) ≥ 1
4. **Kernel Transformation**: Apply kernel function for non-linear boundaries
5. **Prediction**: Classify based on which side of hyperplane data point falls

**Key Concepts**:

##### Linear SVM
**Mathematical Formulation**:
- **Objective**: Minimize ½||w||² + CΣξᵢ
- **Constraints**: yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b) ≥ 1 - ξᵢ, ξᵢ ≥ 0
- **Margin**: 2/||w||
- **Support Vectors**: Points where yᵢ(w·xᵢ + b) = 1

##### Kernel Functions
**Linear Kernel**: K(xᵢ, xⱼ) = xᵢ·xⱼ
- No transformation, works for linearly separable data

**Polynomial Kernel**: K(xᵢ, xⱼ) = (xᵢ·xⱼ + r)^d
- Captures polynomial relationships
- Parameters: degree (d), coefficient (r)

**RBF (Gaussian) Kernel**: K(xᵢ, xⱼ) = exp(-γ||xᵢ - xⱼ||²)
- Most commonly used kernel
- Parameter: γ (gamma) controls smoothness

**Sigmoid Kernel**: K(xᵢ, xⱼ) = tanh(αxᵢ·xⱼ + β)
- Similar to neural network activation

##### Soft Margin SVM
- **C Parameter**: Controls trade-off between margin maximization and error tolerance
- **Slack Variables**: Allow some misclassifications
- **C → ∞**: Hard margin (no errors allowed)
- **C → 0**: More errors allowed, wider margin

**Advantages**:
- **Strong Theoretical Foundation**: Based on statistical learning theory
- **Memory Efficient**: Only stores support vectors
- **Works Well in High Dimensions**: Effective with many features
- **Kernel Flexibility**: Can handle non-linear relationships
- **Global Optimum**: Convex optimization problem
- **Robust**: Less sensitive to outliers than other methods

**Disadvantages**:
- **Slow Training**: O(n³) complexity for large datasets
- **Memory Intensive**: Stores all support vectors
- **Sensitive to Scaling**: Requires feature normalization
- **Kernel Selection**: Choice of kernel and parameters is crucial
- **Black Box**: Less interpretable than linear models
- **Binary Only**: Requires one-vs-one or one-vs-rest for multiclass

**When to use**:
- Small to medium datasets
- High-dimensional data
- Need strong theoretical guarantees
- Non-linear decision boundaries
- When interpretability is less important

### Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

Unsupervised learning is like being an explorer in an uncharted territory - you don't have a map or guide, but you're looking for patterns and structures that might reveal hidden treasures. While supervised learning has a teacher (the labels), unsupervised learning is about discovering the natural organization of data without any external guidance.

It's the difference between learning to recognize animals from a textbook (supervised) versus walking through a forest and noticing that some creatures have feathers and others have fur, then grouping them accordingly (unsupervised). The algorithms in this section are detectives without a case file - they have to figure out what's important and how things relate to each other purely from the data itself.

#### 1. K-Means Clustering

K-Means clustering is like organizing a messy room by grouping similar items together - you don't know beforehand what categories exist, but you can see that some things naturally belong together. Imagine you have a pile of mixed coins and you want to separate them into groups. K-Means would automatically discover that there are quarters, dimes, and pennies, then assign each coin to its appropriate group based on size and appearance.

The algorithm works like a smart organizer that starts by guessing where the centers of different groups should be, then iteratively refines these centers by looking at what items are closest to each center. It's like having a friend who keeps moving the group boundaries until everyone is as close as possible to their group's center.

What's beautiful about K-Means is its simplicity and effectiveness. It doesn't need to know what it's looking for - it just finds natural groupings in the data. However, it assumes that groups are roughly spherical and similar in size, which isn't always true in real life. It's like trying to organize books by throwing them into circular bins - works great for novels of similar size, but not so well for mixing novels with cookbooks and children's picture books.

**Purpose**: Group similar data points into k clusters without prior knowledge of cluster labels
**Mathematical Foundation**:
- **Objective Function**: Minimize Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)
- **WCSS**: Σᵢ₌₁ᵏ Σₓ∈Cᵢ ||x - μᵢ||²
- **Centroids**: μᵢ = (1/|Cᵢ|) Σₓ∈Cᵢ x
- **Distance Metric**: Usually Euclidean distance

**How it works**:
1. **Initialize**: Randomly place k centroids
2. **Assignment**: Assign each point to nearest centroid
3. **Update**: Recalculate centroids based on assigned points
4. **Repeat**: Steps 2-3 until convergence or max iterations
5. **Convergence**: When centroids stop moving significantly

**Key Concepts**:

##### Initialization Methods
**Random Initialization**: Randomly place centroids
- Can lead to poor local minima
- Multiple runs recommended

**K-Means++**: Smart initialization
- First centroid: random point
- Subsequent centroids: farthest from existing centroids
- Reduces chance of poor initialization

##### Distance Metrics
**Euclidean Distance**: √Σ(xᵢ - yᵢ)²
- Most common for continuous features
- Sensitive to feature scaling

**Manhattan Distance**: Σ|xᵢ - yᵢ|
- Less sensitive to outliers
- Good for high-dimensional data

**Cosine Distance**: 1 - (x·y)/(||x|| ||y||)
- Good for text data and high-dimensional data
- Focuses on direction rather than magnitude

**Advantages**:
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Fast**: Efficient for large datasets
- **Scalable**: Works well with many data points
- **Versatile**: Works with various data types
- **Deterministic**: Same initialization gives same result

**Disadvantages**:
- **Requires k**: Must specify number of clusters
- **Sensitive to Initialization**: Can get stuck in local minima
- **Assumes Spherical Clusters**: Struggles with non-spherical shapes
- **Sensitive to Scaling**: Requires feature normalization
- **Outlier Sensitive**: Outliers can skew centroids

**When to use**:
- Know approximate number of clusters
- Spherical cluster shapes
- Large datasets
- Need fast clustering
- Exploratory data analysis

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score, calinski_harabasz_score
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# K-Means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42, n_init=10)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)

# Evaluate clustering quality
silhouette_avg = silhouette_score(X_scaled, clusters)
calinski_score = calinski_harabasz_score(X_scaled, clusters)

print(f"Silhouette Score: {silhouette_avg:.3f}")
print(f"Calinski-Harabasz Score: {calinski_score:.3f}")

# Find optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method
inertias = []

K_range = range(2, 11)

for k in K_range:
    kmeans_temp = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42, n_init=10)
    kmeans_temp.fit(X_scaled)
    inertias.append(kmeans_temp.inertia_)
    silhouette_scores.append(silhouette_score(X_scaled, kmeans_temp.labels_))

for i, center in enumerate(cluster_centers):
    print(f"Cluster {i}: {center}")

# Cluster sizes
cluster_sizes = np.bincount(clusters)
print(f"Cluster sizes: {cluster_sizes}")

# Advanced K-Means variants
from sklearn.cluster import MiniBatchKMeans

# Mini-batch K-Means for large datasets
mini_kmeans = MiniBatchKMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42, batch_size=100)
mini_clusters = mini_kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)

# Compare with regular K-Means
print(f"Regular K-Means Silhouette: {silhouette_score(X_scaled, clusters):.3f}")
print(f"Mini-batch K-Means Silhouette: {silhouette_score(X_scaled, mini_clusters):.3f}")
```

#### 2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principal Component Analysis is like having a master photographer who knows exactly how to position you to capture your best angle - it finds the most important "views" of your data and discards the less informative ones. Imagine you're trying to describe a person's face to someone who's never seen them. You wouldn't mention every single detail - you'd focus on the most distinctive features that capture their essence.

PCA works by finding the directions in your data where there's the most variation - the "principal components" that tell the most interesting stories. It's like looking at a cloud and identifying the main shapes and patterns, rather than trying to describe every single water droplet. The first principal component captures the most important trend, the second captures the next most important trend (orthogonal to the first), and so on.

What makes PCA so powerful is its ability to compress information without losing the essence. It's like creating a perfect summary of a long book - you keep the main plot points and character development, but you don't need every single detail about what the characters had for breakfast. This makes PCA incredibly useful for visualization (reducing 100-dimensional data to 2D for plotting) and for speeding up other algorithms by removing noise and redundancy.

**Purpose**: Dimensionality reduction while preserving maximum variance
**Mathematical Foundation**:
- **Covariance Matrix**: C = (1/n) XᵀX (for centered data)
- **Eigenvalue Decomposition**: C = VΛVᵀ
- **Principal Components**: Eigenvectors of covariance matrix
- **Explained Variance**: Eigenvalues represent variance explained by each component

**How it works**:
1. **Center Data**: Subtract mean from each feature
2. **Compute Covariance Matrix**: Calculate relationships between features
3. **Eigenvalue Decomposition**: Find eigenvectors and eigenvalues
4. **Sort Components**: Order by decreasing eigenvalues
5. **Transform Data**: Project onto principal components

**Key Concepts**:

##### Variance Explained
- **Individual Variance**: Each eigenvalue / sum of all eigenvalues
- **Cumulative Variance**: Running sum of individual variances
- **Rule of Thumb**: Keep components explaining 80-95% of variance

##### Principal Components Properties
- **Orthogonal**: Components are perpendicular to each other
- **Uncorrelated**: No linear relationship between components
- **Maximum Variance**: First component captures most variance
- **Linear Transformation**: PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction

##### Data Preprocessing
- **Centering**: Essential for PCA (subtract mean)
- **Scaling**: Often recommended (divide by standard deviation)
- **Outlier Handling**: PCA is sensitive to outliers

**Advantages**:
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces number of features
- **Noise Reduction**: Removes low-variance components
- **Visualization**: Enables 2D/3D visualization of high-dimensional data
- **Computational Efficiency**: Faster training on reduced dimensions
- **Linear**: Simple linear transformation

**Disadvantages**:
- **Linear Only**: Cannot capture non-linear relationships
- **Interpretability**: Principal components may not be interpretable
- **Information Loss**: Some information always lost
- **Sensitive to Scaling**: Requires careful preprocessing
- **Assumes Gaussian**: Works best with normally distributed data

**When to use**:
- High-dimensional data
- Need dimensionality reduction
- Want to visualize high-dimensional data
- Remove noise from data
- Speed up other algorithms

## Regularization: L1 & L2

### What is Regularization?

Regularization is like having a wise mentor who keeps you from overthinking problems - it prevents your model from becoming too complex and memorizing the training data instead of learning the underlying patterns. Imagine you're studying for an exam by memorizing every single word in the textbook. You might ace the practice tests, but you'll struggle with new questions that test understanding rather than rote memorization.

Regularization techniques are the machine learning equivalent of this wisdom. They add a "complexity penalty" to your model's objective function, encouraging it to find simpler solutions that are more likely to generalize to new data. It's like the difference between a student who memorizes formulas versus one who understands the underlying principles - the latter will perform better on unexpected questions.

The beauty of regularization lies in its ability to balance the trade-off between fitting your training data well and maintaining the ability to perform well on new, unseen data. It's like tuning a musical instrument - you want it to sound good, but not so tightly tuned that it breaks when you play different songs.

### What is Regularization?
Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. It constrains the model's complexity, encouraging simpler models that generalize better to new data.

### Mathematical Foundation

#### Loss Function with Regularization
**Original Loss Function**: L(θ) = Σ Loss(yᵢ, ŷᵢ)

**Regularized Loss Function**: L(θ) = Σ Loss(yᵢ, ŷᵢ) + λ × R(θ)

Where:
- λ (lambda) = regularization parameter (controls strength of penalty)
- R(θ) = regularization term
- θ = model parameters (weights)

### L1 Regularization (Lasso)

#### Mathematical Definition
**L1 Penalty**: R(θ) = Σ|θᵢ| (sum of absolute values of weights)

**Complete Loss Function**: L(θ) = Σ Loss(yᵢ, ŷᵢ) + λ × Σ|θᵢ|

#### Key Characteristics
- **Sparsity**: Drives many weights to exactly zero
- **Feature Selection**: Automatically selects most important features
- **Robust to Outliers**: Less sensitive to extreme values
- **Non-differentiable**: Requires special optimization techniques

#### How L1 Works
1. **Penalty Term**: Adds λ × |weight| to loss for each weight
2. **Sparse Solution**: Forces unimportant weights to zero
3. **Feature Selection**: Only keeps features with non-zero weights
4. **Automatic**: No need for manual feature selection

#### Advantages
- **Automatic Feature Selection**: Removes irrelevant features
- **Interpretability**: Easier to understand with fewer features
- **Robustness**: Less affected by outliers
- **Memory Efficient**: Fewer parameters to store

#### Disadvantages
- **Computational Complexity**: Requires specialized solvers
- **Instability**: Small data changes can cause large weight changes
- **No Closed Form**: Requires iterative optimization

#### When to Use L1
- High-dimensional data with many features
- Need automatic feature selection
- Suspect many irrelevant features
- Want sparse, interpretable models

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso, LassoCV
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

# L1 Regularization (Lasso)
lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.1)  # alpha = λ (regularization parameter)
lasso.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Cross-validation to find optimal alpha
lasso_cv = LassoCV(cv=5, random_state=42)
lasso_cv.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Optimal alpha: {lasso_cv.alpha_:.4f}")

# Check sparsity (number of non-zero coefficients)
n_nonzero = np.sum(lasso.coef_ != 0)
print(f"Number of non-zero coefficients: {n_nonzero}")

# Feature selection results
feature_names = X.columns
selected_features = feature_names[lasso.coef_ != 0]
print(f"Selected features: {selected_features.tolist()}")

# Regularization path (effect of different alpha values)
alphas = np.logspace(-4, 1, 50)
coefs = []
for alpha in alphas:
    lasso_temp = Lasso(alpha=alpha)
    lasso_temp.fit(X_train, y_train)
    coefs.append(lasso_temp.coef_)

# Plot regularization path
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
for i, coef in enumerate(np.array(coefs).T):
    plt.plot(alphas, coef, label=f'Feature {i}')
plt.xscale('log')
plt.xlabel('Alpha (Regularization Parameter)')
plt.ylabel('Coefficient Value')
plt.title('L1 Regularization Path')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### L2 Regularization (Ridge)

#### Mathematical Definition
**L2 Penalty**: R(θ) = Σθᵢ² (sum of squared weights)

**Complete Loss Function**: L(θ) = Σ Loss(yᵢ, ŷᵢ) + λ × Σθᵢ²

#### Key Characteristics
- **Smooth Shrinking**: Reduces all weights proportionally
- **No Sparsity**: Keeps all features but with smaller weights
- **Differentiable**: Easy to optimize with gradient descent
- **Stable**: Robust to small data changes

#### How L2 Works
1. **Penalty Term**: Adds λ × weight² to loss for each weight
2. **Weight Shrinking**: Reduces magnitude of all weights
3. **Smooth Solution**: All features retained but with smaller impact
4. **Stability**: Less sensitive to data variations

#### Advantages
- **Numerical Stability**: Easier to solve mathematically
- **Handles Multicollinearity**: Works well with correlated features
- **Smooth Optimization**: Gradient descent works well
- **No Feature Loss**: Keeps all features

#### Disadvantages
- **No Feature Selection**: Doesn't remove irrelevant features
- **Less Interpretable**: Harder to understand with many features
- **Computational Cost**: More parameters to optimize

#### When to Use L2
- Multicollinear features
- Need numerical stability
- Want to keep all features
- High-dimensional data without clear irrelevant features

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, RidgeCV
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# L2 Regularization (Ridge)
ridge = Ridge(alpha=1.0)  # alpha = λ (regularization parameter)
ridge.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Cross-validation to find optimal alpha
ridge_cv = RidgeCV(cv=5, alphas=np.logspace(-4, 4, 50))
ridge_cv.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Optimal alpha: {ridge_cv.alpha_:.4f}")

# Compare with linear regression
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
lr = LinearRegression()
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Compare coefficients
print("Linear Regression coefficients:")
print(lr.coef_)
print("\nRidge coefficients:")
print(ridge.coef_)

# Check coefficient shrinkage
shrinkage = np.sum(np.abs(ridge.coef_)) / np.sum(np.abs(lr.coef_))
print(f"Coefficient shrinkage: {shrinkage:.2f}")

# Regularization path
alphas = np.logspace(-4, 4, 50)
coefs = []
for alpha in alphas:
    ridge_temp = Ridge(alpha=alpha)
    ridge_temp.fit(X_train, y_train)
    coefs.append(ridge_temp.coef_)

# Plot regularization path
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
for i, coef in enumerate(np.array(coefs).T):
    plt.plot(alphas, coef, label=f'Feature {i}')
plt.xscale('log')
plt.xlabel('Alpha (Regularization Parameter)')
plt.ylabel('Coefficient Value')
plt.title('L2 Regularization Path')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### Elastic Net: Combining L1 and L2

#### Mathematical Definition
**Elastic Net Penalty**: R(θ) = α × Σ|θᵢ| + (1-α) × Σθᵢ²

Where α controls the mix:
- α = 1: Pure L1 (Lasso)
- α = 0: Pure L2 (Ridge)
- 0 < α < 1: Combination of both

#### Advantages
- **Best of Both**: Combines L1 feature selection with L2 stability
- **Handles Correlated Features**: Better than pure L1
- **Flexible**: Can tune the L1/L2 balance

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet, ElasticNetCV

# Elastic Net (combines L1 and L2)
elastic_net = ElasticNet(alpha=0.1, l1_ratio=0.5)  # l1_ratio = α
elastic_net.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Cross-validation to find optimal parameters
elastic_cv = ElasticNetCV(cv=5, l1_ratio=[0.1, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99])
elastic_cv.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Optimal alpha: {elastic_cv.alpha_:.4f}")
print(f"Optimal l1_ratio: {elastic_cv.l1_ratio_:.2f}")

# Compare different regularization methods
models = {
    'Linear Regression': LinearRegression(),
    'L1 (Lasso)': Lasso(alpha=0.1),
    'L2 (Ridge)': Ridge(alpha=1.0),
    'Elastic Net': ElasticNet(alpha=0.1, l1_ratio=0.5)
}

for name, model in models.items():
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
    n_features = np.sum(model.coef_ != 0) if hasattr(model, 'coef_') else len(model.coef_)
    print(f"{name}: R² = {score:.3f}, Features = {n_features}")
```

### Choosing Regularization Parameters

#### Cross-Validation Approach
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import validation_curve

# Validation curve for L1
param_range = np.logspace(-4, 1, 20)
train_scores, val_scores = validation_curve(
    Lasso(), X_train, y_train, 
    param_name='alpha', param_range=param_range,
    cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error'
)

# Plot validation curve
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.semilogx(param_range, -train_scores.mean(axis=1), 'o-', label='Training')
plt.semilogx(param_range, -val_scores.mean(axis=1), 'o-', label='Validation')
plt.xlabel('Alpha (Regularization Parameter)')
plt.ylabel('Mean Squared Error')
plt.title('L1 Regularization Validation Curve')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

#### Grid Search Approach
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Grid search for Elastic Net
param_grid = {
    'alpha': [0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0],
    'l1_ratio': [0.1, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    ElasticNet(), param_grid, cv=5, 
    scoring='neg_mean_squared_error'
)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f"Best parameters: {grid_search.best_params_}")
print(f"Best score: {-grid_search.best_score_:.3f}")
```

### Practical Guidelines

#### When to Use Each Regularization
1. **No Regularization**: Small datasets, no overfitting concerns
2. **L1 (Lasso)**: Many features, need feature selection
3. **L2 (Ridge)**: Multicollinear features, numerical stability needed
4. **Elastic Net**: High-dimensional data with correlated features

#### Parameter Selection Tips
- **Start with Cross-Validation**: Use CV to find optimal λ
- **Consider Data Scale**: Scale features before regularization
- **Monitor Sparsity**: For L1, check how many features are selected
- **Validate Performance**: Always test on held-out data

#### Common Pitfalls
- **Forgetting to Scale**: Regularization is sensitive to feature scale
- **Wrong Parameter Range**: Use log scale for α/λ search
- **Ignoring CV**: Don't tune on test data
- **Over-regularization**: Too high λ can cause underfitting

## Deep Learning Fundamentals

### What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is like having a team of specialized experts, each building on the work of the previous expert to solve increasingly complex problems. Imagine you're trying to recognize a cat in a photo. The first expert might look for simple patterns like edges and curves. The second expert combines these into shapes like ears and tails. The third expert recognizes these shapes as parts of animals. Finally, the last expert determines that the combination of these parts forms a cat.

This is essentially how deep neural networks work - they're composed of multiple layers, each learning increasingly abstract representations of the data. The "deep" in deep learning refers to having many of these layers stacked together, allowing the network to learn very complex patterns that would be impossible for simpler models to capture.

What makes deep learning so powerful is its ability to automatically learn feature representations from raw data. Traditional machine learning requires you to manually engineer features (like extracting edges, textures, or shapes from images), but deep learning learns these features automatically through the training process. It's like having a student who not only learns to solve problems but also learns to identify what makes a problem solvable in the first place.

### What is Deep Learning?
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to model and understand complex patterns in data. It's inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.

### Neural Networks Basics

#### Architecture Components
- **Input Layer**: Receives raw data (features)
- **Hidden Layers**: Process information through weighted connections
- **Output Layer**: Produces final predictions
- **Neurons/Nodes**: Basic processing units
- **Weights**: Learnable parameters that determine connection strength
- **Biases**: Additional learnable parameters for each neuron

#### Mathematical Foundation
**Single Neuron**: y = f(Σ(wᵢ × xᵢ) + b)

Where:
- xᵢ = input values
- wᵢ = weights
- b = bias
- f = activation function
- y = output

**Forward Propagation**:
1. Calculate weighted sum: z = Σ(wᵢ × xᵢ) + b
2. Apply activation function: a = f(z)
3. Pass to next layer

#### Activation Functions

##### ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
**Formula**: f(x) = max(0, x)
**Advantages**:
- Computationally efficient
- Helps with vanishing gradient problem
- Sparse activation (many zeros)
**Disadvantages**:
- Dead neurons (output always 0)
- Not differentiable at x=0

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# ReLU activation
x = torch.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
relu = nn.ReLU()
y_relu = relu(x)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)
plt.plot(x.numpy(), y_relu.numpy())
plt.title('ReLU Activation')
plt.grid(True)
```

##### Sigmoid
**Formula**: f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
**Advantages**:
- Smooth, differentiable everywhere
- Output between 0 and 1
- Good for probability outputs
**Disadvantages**:
- Vanishing gradient problem
- Not zero-centered
- Computationally expensive

```python
# Sigmoid activation
sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()
y_sigmoid = sigmoid(x)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)
plt.plot(x.numpy(), y_sigmoid.numpy())
plt.title('Sigmoid Activation')
plt.grid(True)
```

##### Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)
**Formula**: f(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / (e^x + e^(-x))
**Advantages**:
- Zero-centered output (-1 to 1)
- Stronger gradients than sigmoid
**Disadvantages**:
- Still has vanishing gradient problem
- Computationally expensive

```python
# Tanh activation
tanh = nn.Tanh()
y_tanh = tanh(x)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
plt.plot(x.numpy(), y_tanh.numpy())
plt.title('Tanh Activation')
plt.grid(True)
```

##### Leaky ReLU
**Formula**: f(x) = x if x > 0, else 0.01x
**Advantages**:
- Fixes dead neuron problem
- Computationally efficient
- Small negative slope prevents zero gradients

```python
# Leaky ReLU activation
leaky_relu = nn.LeakyReLU(0.01)
y_leaky_relu = leaky_relu(x)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
plt.plot(x.numpy(), y_leaky_relu.numpy())
plt.title('Leaky ReLU Activation')
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

#### Backpropagation Algorithm
Backpropagation is the algorithm used to train neural networks by computing gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight.

**Process**:
1. **Forward Pass**: Compute predictions using current weights
2. **Compute Loss**: Calculate error between predictions and targets
3. **Backward Pass**: Compute gradients using chain rule
4. **Update Weights**: Adjust weights using gradient descent

**Mathematical Foundation**:
- Chain Rule: ∂L/∂w = ∂L/∂a × ∂a/∂z × ∂z/∂w
- Gradient Descent: w = w - α × ∂L/∂w

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Simple neural network
class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.sigmoid(self.fc2(x))
        return x

# Training example
model = SimpleNN(input_size=4, hidden_size=8, output_size=1)
criterion = nn.BCELoss()  # Binary cross-entropy loss
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
def train_model(model, train_loader, epochs=100):
    model.train()
    for epoch in range(epochs):
        total_loss = 0
        for batch_x, batch_y in train_loader:
            # Forward pass
            outputs = model(batch_x)
            loss = criterion(outputs, batch_y)
            
            # Backward pass
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            
            total_loss += loss.item()
        
        if epoch % 10 == 0:
            print(f'Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {total_loss/len(train_loader):.4f}')
```

### Gradient Descent Variants

#### Batch Gradient Descent
- Uses entire dataset for each update
- Stable but slow for large datasets
- Memory intensive

#### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Uses one sample at a time
- Fast but noisy updates
- Can get stuck in local minima

#### Mini-batch Gradient Descent
- Uses small batches (32-256 samples)
- Balance between stability and speed
- Most commonly used in practice

#### Advanced Optimizers

##### Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)
**Advantages**:
- Combines momentum and adaptive learning rates
- Works well with sparse gradients
- Fast convergence
- Good default choice

```python
# Adam optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, betas=(0.9, 0.999))

# Adam with weight decay (L2 regularization)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, weight_decay=1e-4)
```

##### RMSprop
**Advantages**:
- Adapts learning rate per parameter
- Good for non-stationary objectives
- Handles sparse gradients well

```python
# RMSprop optimizer
optimizer = optim.RMSprop(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, alpha=0.99)
```

### Regularization in Deep Learning

#### Dropout
Randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training to prevent overfitting.

```python
class DropoutNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size, dropout_rate=0.5):
        super(DropoutNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout_rate)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout(x)  # Apply dropout
        x = self.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.dropout(x)  # Apply dropout
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x
```

#### Batch Normalization
Normalizes inputs to each layer to reduce internal covariate shift.

```python
class BatchNormNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(BatchNormNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm1d(hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.bn1(self.fc1(x)))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x
```

#### Weight Decay (L2 Regularization)
Adds penalty term to loss function based on weight magnitudes.

```python
# Weight decay in optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, weight_decay=1e-4)

# Or manually in loss function
def l2_regularization(model, lambda_reg=1e-4):
    l2_reg = torch.tensor(0.)
    for param in model.parameters():
        l2_reg += torch.norm(param)
    return lambda_reg * l2_reg

# Add to loss
loss = criterion(outputs, targets) + l2_regularization(model)
```

        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(32 * 16 * 16, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 32 * 16 * 16)

import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Define model
class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

## Advanced Topics

### Ensemble Methods

#### Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)
**Concept**: Train multiple models on different bootstrap samples of the data, then average predictions.

**Advantages**:
- Reduces variance
- Parallelizable
- Works well with high-variance models

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Bagging with decision trees
bagging = BaggingClassifier(
    base_estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier(),
    n_estimators=100,
    max_samples=0.8,
    max_features=0.8,
    random_state=42
)
bagging.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### Boosting
**Concept**: Train models sequentially, where each model focuses on mistakes of previous models.

**Types**:
- **AdaBoost**: Adaptive boosting
- **Gradient Boosting**: Uses gradient descent
- **XGBoost**: Optimized gradient boosting
- **LightGBM**: Light gradient boosting

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
import xgboost as xgb

# AdaBoost
adaboost = AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=1.0)
adaboost.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Gradient Boosting
gb = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3)
gb.fit(X_train, y_train)

# XGBoost
xgb_model = xgb.XGBClassifier(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3)
xgb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### Stacking
**Concept**: Train a meta-model to combine predictions from multiple base models.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import StackingClassifier
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Stacking ensemble
stacking = StackingClassifier(
    estimators=[
        ('rf', RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)),
        ('svm', SVC(probability=True)),
        ('gb', GradientBoostingClassifier())
    ],
    final_estimator=LogisticRegression(),
    cv=5
)
stacking.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Advanced Neural Network Architectures

#### Residual Networks (ResNet)
**Purpose**: Solve vanishing gradient problem in deep networks
**Key Innovation**: Skip connections that allow gradients to flow directly

```python
class ResidualBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, stride=1):
        super(ResidualBlock, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, 3, stride, 1)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(out_channels, out_channels, 3, 1, 1)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        
        # Skip connection
        self.shortcut = nn.Sequential()
        if stride != 1 or in_channels != out_channels:
            self.shortcut = nn.Sequential(
                nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, 1, stride),
                nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
            )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        residual = x
        out = F.relu(self.bn1(self.conv1(x)))
        out = self.bn2(self.conv2(out))
        out += self.shortcut(residual)  # Skip connection
        out = F.relu(out)
        return out
```

#### Attention Mechanisms
**Purpose**: Allow models to focus on relevant parts of input
**Applications**: Transformers, image captioning, machine translation

```python
class Attention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size):
        super(Attention, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.attention = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
    
    def forward(self, encoder_outputs):
        # Calculate attention weights
        attention_weights = F.softmax(self.attention(encoder_outputs), dim=1)
        # Apply attention weights
        context_vector = torch.sum(attention_weights * encoder_outputs, dim=1)
        return context_vector, attention_weights
```

### Transfer Learning
**Concept**: Use pre-trained models on new tasks with limited data

#### Image Classification Transfer Learning
```python
import torchvision.models as models
import torch.nn as nn

# Load pre-trained ResNet
resnet = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Freeze early layers
for param in resnet.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Modify final layer for new task
num_classes = 10  # New number of classes
resnet.fc = nn.Linear(resnet.fc.in_features, num_classes)

# Only train the final layer
optimizer = optim.Adam(resnet.fc.parameters(), lr=0.001)
```

#### NLP Transfer Learning
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

# Load pre-trained BERT
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    'bert-base-uncased',
    num_labels=2  # Binary classification
)

# Fine-tune on new task
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=64,
    warmup_steps=500,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir='./logs',
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
)
```

    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'max_depth': [3, 5, 10],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(
    RandomForestClassifier(),
    param_grid,
    cv=5,
    scoring='accuracy',
    n_jobs=-1
)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### Random Search
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV
from scipy.stats import randint, uniform

param_distributions = {
    'n_estimators': randint(50, 200),
    'max_depth': randint(3, 20),
    'min_samples_split': randint(2, 20),
    'min_samples_leaf': randint(1, 10)
}

random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(
    RandomForestClassifier(),
    param_distributions,
    n_iter=100,
    cv=5,
    scoring='accuracy',
    random_state=42
)
random_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

#### Bayesian Optimization
```python
from skopt import gp_minimize
from skopt.space import Real, Integer
from skopt.utils import use_named_args

# Define search space
dimensions = [
    Integer(50, 200, name='n_estimators'),
    Integer(3, 20, name='max_depth'),
    Real(0.01, 1.0, name='min_samples_split'),
    Real(0.01, 0.5, name='min_samples_leaf')
]

@use_named_args(dimensions=dimensions)
def objective(**params):
    model = RandomForestClassifier(**params)
    scores = cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=5)
    return -scores.mean()

# Optimize
result = gp_minimize(objective, dimensions, n_calls=50, random_state=42)
```

### Model Interpretability

#### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
```python
import shap

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Create SHAP explainer
explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)

# Plot summary
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test)

# Plot individual prediction
shap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value, shap_values[0], X_test.iloc[0])
```

#### LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
```python
import lime
import lime.lime_tabular

# Create LIME explainer
explainer = lime.lime_tabular.LimeTabularExplainer(
    X_train.values,
    feature_names=X_train.columns,
    class_names=['Class 0', 'Class 1'],
    mode='classification'
)

# Explain individual prediction
explanation = explainer.explain_instance(
    X_test.iloc[0].values,
    model.predict_proba,
    num_features=len(X_train.columns)
)
explanation.show_in_notebook()
```

### Time Series Analysis

#### ARIMA Models
```python
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA
import pandas as pd

# Fit ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(time_series_data, order=(1, 1, 1))
fitted_model = model.fit()

# Make predictions
forecast = fitted_model.forecast(steps=10)
```

#### LSTM for Time Series
```python
class LSTMModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, output_size):
        super(LSTMModel, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_size = hidden_size
        self.num_layers = num_layers
        
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        h0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size)
        c0 = torch.zeros(self.num_layers, x.size(0), self.hidden_size)
        
        out, _ = self.lstm(x, (h0, c0))
        out = self.fc(out[:, -1, :])
        return out
```

### Advanced Evaluation Techniques

train_sizes, train_scores, val_scores = learning_curve(
    RandomForestClassifier(),
    X, y,
    train_sizes=np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10),
    cv=5,
    scoring='accuracy'

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(train_sizes, train_scores.mean(axis=1), 'o-', label='Training')

plt.fill_between(train_sizes, 
                 train_scores.mean(axis=1) - train_scores.std(axis=1),
                 train_scores.mean(axis=1) + train_scores.std(axis=1),
                 alpha=0.1)
plt.xlabel('Training Set Size')

with mlflow.start_run(run_name=f"model_v{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}"):
    # Log parameters
    mlflow.log_param("algorithm", "RandomForest")
    mlflow.log_param("n_estimators", 100)

    treatment_mean = np.mean(treatment_metric)
    
    # Perform t-test
    t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(control_metric, treatment_metric)
    
    # Determine significance
    is_significant = p_value < alpha
    
    return {
        'control_mean': control_mean,
